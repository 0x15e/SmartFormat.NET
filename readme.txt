An Extended String formatter for .Net.

Supports named placeholders along with sytax for outputting lists of values and for using conditional formatting in-line.

All credit for this project belongs to Scott Rippey for his original extended string formatting work at http://www.codeproject.com/KB/string/Custom_Formatting.aspx.  This project is nothing more than a C# port and minor API refactor of his project.
