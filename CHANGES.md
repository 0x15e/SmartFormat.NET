LATEST CHANGES
====

v1.3
====
- Added "Named Formatters", which allows you to use a
  specific formatter by specifying its name.  
  For example, "{0:plural: ___ }" will use the Plural formatter,
  and "{0:default: ___ }" will use the default formatter.
- Added "Formatter Options", which allows you to specify options
  for a named formatter.  This will be used in the near future.  
  For example, "{0:name(options): ___ }"

v1.2
====
- Added .NET v3.5 and .NET v4.0 builds
- Added "releases" folder to hold official releases
- Added `UseAlternativeBraces` method, so that templates can use alternative characters
- Added `SmartFormatter.GetFormatterExtension` and `GetSourceExtension` methods, 
  which can be used to configure extensions
- Added `DefaultTwoLetterISOLanguageName` properties to the `TimeSpanFormatter` and `PluralLocalizationFormatter`
- Fixed `AddExtensions` to insert new extensions before existing ones (otherwise, it's pretty useless) (#17)
